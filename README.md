Programs used to obtain pulse profiles of X-ray pulsar with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data 

These programs include:

-Select data from Nustar or XMM-Newton fits files

-Search frequency of the pulsar

-Represent the pulse profiles in differents energy ranges

-Adjusment of pulse profiles by five sinusoids
